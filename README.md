## HedgeRender
A C++11 graphics/rendering engine with a fully-C89-compatible API designed around modern rendering APIs for speed and portability. Currently, it only supports Direct3D 11, but it has been designed from the ground up to work well with modern APIs such as Direct3D 12 and Vulkan, so porting it to those backends shouldn't be difficult.

## HedgeTools
A collection of miscellaneous tools that utilize HedgeLib to allow editing a wide array of formats.

Right now this includes the following:

- [HedgeEdit](HedgeTools/HedgeEdit)
  * A C89 level editor built on top of HedgeLib and HedgeRender that I ultimately hope to allow for quick and powerful editing of levels from every mainline 3D Sonic game in the series (think "SonicGlvl" but for more than just Generations).
  Right now it's a major WIP, though feel free to try it out!
- [HedgeArcPack](HedgeTools/HedgeArcPack)
  * A C89 Command-Line tool that allows quick and powerful extraction and generation of archiving formats from all games HedgeLib supports.
- [HedgeOffsets](HedgeTools/HedgeOffsets)
  * A C89 Command-Line tool that reads the offset table in BINA/Hedgehog Engine formats and prints each offset. Useful for debugging and reverse-engineering of undocumented formats which contain an offset table.

# Manually Building
Building HedgeLib is supposed to be easy.
If you're having trouble building with the following instructions, please [create an issue](https://github.com/Radfordhound/HedgeLib/issues/new).

## Windows (Visual Studio)
**1: Install the Windows SDK if you don't already have it:**
You can install it either from the Visual Studio Installer by selecting "Windows 10 SDK" from the "Individual Components" list, or from [this link](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk).

**2: Clone the HedgeLib repository and go into its folder:**
```
git clone https://github.com/Radfordhound/HedgeLib.git
cd HedgeLib
```

**3: Switch to the HedgeLib++ branch:**
```
git switch HedgeLib++
```

**4: Download Premake from [here](https://premake.github.io/download.html) and extract it to the directory you cloned HedgeLib to.**

HedgeLib uses Premake for easy Project/Makefile generation across different platforms/IDEs.

**5: Generate a Visual Studio Solution (.sln file) with Premake:**
```
premake5 vs2019
```

If you're using a different version of Visual Studio, simply replace ```vs2019``` with the version you're using.
(E.G. to use Visual Studio 2017, type ```premake5 vs2017``` instead.)

MinGW/Cygwin/etc. aren't officially supported/tested, but should also work fine. Just type ```premake5 gmake2``` to generate a Makefile instead.

**6: Open the resulting HedgeLib.sln file in Visual Studio and hit "Build Solution" (or Ctrl+Shift+B).**

Or, if you're using MinGW/Cygwin/etc., just run "make".

## macOS
**1: Clone the HedgeLib repository and go into its folder:**
```
git clone https://github.com/Radfordhound/HedgeLib.git
cd HedgeLib
```

**2: Switch to the HedgeLib++ branch:**
```
git switch HedgeLib++
```

**3: Download Premake from [here](https://premake.github.io/download.html) and extract it to the directory you cloned HedgeLib to.**

HedgeLib uses Premake for easy Project/Makefile generation across different platforms/IDEs.

**4: Run Premake:**
```
./premake5 xcode4
```

**5: Open the resulting HedgeLib.xcworkspace file in Xcode and build there.**

Alternatively, you can build from the terminal by ```cd```ing into the directory of the tool you want to build (e.g. HedgeTools/HedgeOffsets) and entering the following command:
```
xcodebuild
```

By default, this should compile a Debug build. To compile a Release build, simply run the following command instead:
```
xcodebuild -configuration Release
```

## Linux
**1: Install the following packages** (or equivalents for your distro of choice):
```
git
gcc
make
premake5
```

If your distro of choice does not have a premake5 package, you may have to download Premake from [here](https://premake.github.io/download.html).

(You can also use Clang in-place of GCC if you wish.)

**2: Clone the HedgeLib repository and go into its folder:**
```
git clone https://github.com/Radfordhound/HedgeLib.git
cd HedgeLib
```

**3: Switch to the HedgeLib++ branch:**
```
git switch HedgeLib++
```

**4: Generate a Makefile with Premake:**
```
premake5 gmake2
```

This will use GCC by default. If you wish to build using Clang instead of GCC, run ```premake5 gmake2 --cc=clang``` instead.

**5: Run the Makefile:**
```
make config=debug_x64
```

To build with a different configuration, simply replace ```debug_x64``` with any of the following options:

- debug_x86     (Debug build for 32-bit x86 Architecture)
- debug_x64     (Debug build for 64-bit x86 Architecture)
- release_x86   (Release build for 32-bit x86 Architecture)
- release_x64   (Release build for 64-bit x86 Architecture)

Building for non-x86 architectures (such as ARM, PowerPC, etc.) should also work correctly, but currently it's not officially supported.
