HedgeLib, HedgeRender, and the HedgeTools are all released under the MIT License detailed
within License.txt. However, HedgeLib, HedgeRender, and the HedgeTools all rely on a
few third-party libraries which are released under their own licenses.

This file details each one of those third-party libraries and, of course, its license.
